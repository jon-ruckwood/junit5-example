# junit5-example

Reference project for getting started with [JUnit 5][0], [Mockito][1] and [AssertJ][2].

JUnit 5 has been released, a `MockitoExtension` exists and there is some backwards support for some JUnit 4 rule types. 

You may find yourself having to perform some manual integration if a rule is not supported, e.g. WireMock.
